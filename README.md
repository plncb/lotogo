So I was wondering, can programming increase your chances of winning at lottery games.

So I create two programs:
- one which gives me most probable winning numbers, based on a set of maths rules.
- the second which, given an input of numbers, returns if you would have win based on previous draw.

(DISCLAIMER: I do not play lottery games, I only create those programs to train myself with the go programming language.)
